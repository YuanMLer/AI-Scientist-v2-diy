Abstract
MobileNetV3, proposed at ICCV 2019, has emerged as a cornerstone of lightweight CNN design, integrating the inverted residual structure of MobileNetV2, squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention modules, and novel hard-swish/hard-sigmoid activation functions to strike a balance between computational efficiency and task performance on standard benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet). Tailored for resource-constrained mobile and edge computing environments, it has become a go-to backbone for applications ranging from on-device computer vision to edge-based object detection and segmentation. However, despite its impressive benchmark results, MobileNetV3 faces significant hurdles when transitioning from controlled lab settings to dynamic real-world deployment—limitations that are often overlooked in the pursuit of state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark metrics.
This work aims to unpack the multifaceted challenges of MobileNetV3 in practical applications: architecturally, its reliance on SE modules introduces unexpected latency overhead on low-end edge hardware, while the hard-swish activation function suffers from precision loss under integer quantization (a common edge deployment strategy); in terms of generalization, MobileNetV3 exhibits sensitivity to real-world distribution shifts (e.g., varying lighting, low-resolution inputs, and domain mismatch), leading to drastic performance drops compared to benchmark environments; additionally, its narrow focus on single-task optimization limits adaptability to multi-task edge scenarios (e.g., simultaneous classification and tracking), and its lightweight design compromises robustness to adversarial perturbations and input corruption—critical issues for safety-critical edge applications (e.g., automotive vision, healthcare wearables).
By examining these challenges across dimensions (architectural tradeoffs, deployment optimization, generalization, and robustness), we seek to identify common failure modes of MobileNetV3 in real-world edge computing. We also highlight the need to move beyond benchmark-centric optimization, advocating for a shift toward hardware-aware architecture refinement, quantization-friendly design, and distributionally robust training strategies for MobileNetV3. Understanding these practical limitations not only informs the iterative improvement of MobileNetV3 and subsequent lightweight CNNs (e.g., MobileViT, FBNetV2) but also accelerates the translation of lightweight vision models from lab benchmarks to reliable, real-world edge AI applications. Ultimately, addressing these challenges will drive the development of more robust, efficient, and practical lightweight CNNs that meet the demands of edge computing in diverse real-world contexts.
