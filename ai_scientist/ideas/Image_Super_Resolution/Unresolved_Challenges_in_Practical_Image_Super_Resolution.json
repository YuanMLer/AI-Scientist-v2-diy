        "Related Work": "Recent studies identify emergent abilities in large language models (Wei et al., 2022) and attribute them to scale. Mixture\u2011of\u2011Experts frameworks (Shazeer et al., 2020) show modular specialization but require costly routing overhead. Probing literature (Wang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023) assesses knowledge through linear probes, yet does not manipulate model behavior. Our work bridges these gaps by introducing a dynamic, input\u2011conditioned routing mechanism that selects compact subnetwork modules at inference time, enabling causal analysis and enhancement of emergent capabilities while keeping parameter updates minimal.",
        "Abstract": "Foundation models exhibit abilities\u2014such as multi\u2011step reasoning or code synthesis\u2014that appear only beyond certain scale thresholds. These emergent capabilities are difficult to interpret because they arise from distributed network dynamics. We propose a modular probing framework in which a small router, conditioned on input embeddings, selects one of several pre\u2011trained subnetwork modules specialized for distinct tasks (e.g., logical inference, programming). The router is trained via a simple gating loss that encourages sparse selection and can be fine\u2011tuned with only a few hundred steps. By systematically varying the router\u2019s conditioning, we probe how specific module activations contribute to emergent behavior, measure performance on benchmark reasoning and code generation suites, and conduct ablation studies on routing sparsity, module size, and training data. Our approach offers a tractable way to dissect and boost emergent abilities without full model fine\u2011tuning, opening new avenues for controlled manipulation of large language models.",
